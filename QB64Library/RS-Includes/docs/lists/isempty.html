It is often important to determine if a list is empty.  This can be done
in many ways, but only two are worth mentioning.  If either the <b>lh_TailPred&amp;</b>
field is pointing to the list header or the <b>ln_Succ&amp;</b> field of the node
<b>lh_Head&amp;</b> is pointing to is zero, then the list is empty.

In code, for example, these methods would be written as follows:

    &#39;You can use this method...
    IF PeekL&amp;(list&amp;, lh_TailPred&amp;) = list&amp; THEN PRINT &quot;List is empty.&quot;

    &#39;Or you can use this method
    IF PeekL&amp;(PeekL&amp;(list&amp;, lh_Head&amp;), ln_Succ&amp;) = 0 THEN PRINT &quot;List is empty.&quot;

Even if there is only one line of code required for this check, there is
a FUNCTION <b>IsListEmpty&amp;</b> set up to do this check.  You should use it to
make your programs more readable.

For example:

    IF IsListEmpty&amp;(list&amp;) THEN PRINT &quot;List is empty.&quot;
