The SUB <b>Insert</b> is used for inserting a new node into any position in
a list.  It always inserts the node following a specified node that is
already part of the list.  For example, &quot;<b>Insert</b> <i>list&amp;</i>, <i>node&amp;</i>, <i>pred&amp;</i>&quot;
inserts the node <i>node&amp;</i> after the node <i>pred&amp;</i> in the specified <i>list&amp;</i>.
If the <i>pred&amp;</i> node points to the list header or is zero, the new node
will be inserted at the head of the list.  Similarly, if the <i>pred&amp;</i> node
points to the <b>lh_Tail&amp;</b> of the list, the new node will be inserted at
the tail of the list.  However, both of these actions can be better
accomplished with the SUBs <b>AddHead</b> and <b>AddTail</b>.

The SUB <b>Remove</b> is used to remove a specified node from a list.  For
example, &quot;<b>Remove</b> <i>node&amp;</i>&quot; will remove the specified <i>node&amp;</i> from whatever
list it is in.  To be removed, a node <u>must</u> actually be in a list.
If you attempt to remove a node that is not in a list, then you may cause
serious corruption to the administrative structure of the GP Memory system
implemented with the <b>memory.bi/.bm</b> include files, or you may destroy any
objects stored in this memory region.  So in fact, if you get those memory
corruption errors, then don&#39;t forget to check, if you unintentionally
remove any nodes, which are not linked into a list.
