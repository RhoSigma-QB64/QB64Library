<pre style="font-size:20px">
A Node structure is divided into three parts: linkage, information, and
content.  The linkage part contains memory pointers to the node&#39;s
successor and predecessor nodes.  The information part contains the node
type, the priority, and a name pointer.  The content part stores the
actual data structure of interest.
<hr>
For nodes that require linkage only, a small <b>MinListNode&amp;</b> structure
is used:

    DefSTRUCTURE MinListNode&amp;, 0&amp;
    DefGPMPTR    mln_Succ&amp;
    DefGPMPTR    mln_Pred&amp;
    DefLABEL     MinListNode_SizeOf&amp;

mln_Succ&amp;
    points to the next node in the list (successor)

mln_Pred&amp;
    points to the previous node in the list (predecessor)
<hr>
When a type, priority, or name is required, a full-featured <b>ListNode&amp;</b>
structure is used:

    DefSTRUCTURE ListNode&amp;, 0&amp;
    DefGPMPTR    ln_Succ&amp;
    DefGPMPTR    ln_Pred&amp;
    DefUBYTE     ln_Type&amp;
    DefBYTE      ln_Pri&amp;
    DefGPMSTR    ln_Name&amp;
    DefLABEL     ListNode_SizeOf&amp;

ln_Succ&amp;
    points to the next node in the list (successor)

ln_Pred&amp;
    points to the previous node in the list (predecessor)

ln_Type&amp;
    defines the type of the node (&quot;NT_&quot; types)

ln_Pri&amp;
    specifies the priority of the node  (+127 (highest) to -128 (lowest))

ln_Name&amp;
    points to a printable name for the node (a zero terminated string)
<hr>
The <b>MinListNode&amp;</b> and/or <b>ListNode&amp;</b> structures are often incorporated into
larger structures, so groups of the larger structures can easily be linked
together.  For example, an addressbook entry could be defined as follows:

    DefSTRUCTURE Person&amp;,<b>MinListNode_SizeOf&amp;</b> &#39;the carrier <b>MinListNode&amp;</b> for content data
    DefGPMSTR    p_FirstName&amp;
    DefGPMSTR    p_LastName&amp;
    DefGPMSTR    p_Street&amp;
    DefGPMSTR    p_City&amp;
    DefULONG     p_ZIP&amp;
    DefGPMSTR    p_State&amp;
    DefGPMSTR    p_Phone&amp;
    DefGPMSTR    p_Fax&amp;
    DefLABEL     p_SizeOf&amp;

Here the <b>p_FirstName&amp;</b> to <b>p_Fax&amp;</b> fields represent the useful content of the
node.  Because the <b>Person&amp;</b> structure begins with a (<b>Min</b>)<b>ListNode&amp;</b> structure,
it may directly be passed to any of the list handling SUBs and FUNCTIONs in
place of the required node argument.

Before linking a node into a list, certain fields may need initialization.
Initialization consists of setting the <b>ln_Type&amp;</b>, <b>ln_Pri&amp;</b>, and <b>ln_Name&amp;</b> fields
to their appropriate values (A <b>MinListNode&amp;</b> structure does not have these
fields).  The successor and predecessor fields do not require initialization.
<hr>
Description of all fields and its possible initialization values:

The <b>ln_Type&amp;</b> field contains the data type of the node.  This indicates the
type, and hence the structure, of the content portion of the node (the extra
data after the <b>ListNode&amp;</b> structure).  The standard types are defined in the
<b>lists.bi</b> include file.  If you do not need a type, but just a priority
and/or name, then initialize the type field to <b>NT_UNKNOWN&amp;</b> (zero).

The <b>ln_Pri&amp;</b> field uses a signed numerical value ranging from +127 to -128
to indicate the priority of the node.  Higher-priority nodes have greater
values: for example, 127 is the highest priority, zero is nominal priority,
and -128 is the lowest priority.  Some lists may need to be kept sorted
by priority order.  In such lists, the highest-priority node is at the head
of the list, and the lowest-priority node is at the tail of the list.  If
you do not need a priority, but just a type and/or name, then initialize
the priority field to zero.

The <b>ln_Name&amp;</b> field is a pointer to a zero terminated string of characters.
Node names are used to find and identify list-bound objects, and to bind
symbolic names to actual nodes.  Names are also useful for debugging.  Take
care to provide a valid name pointer, best one created with the FUNCTION
<b>CreateGPMString&amp;</b>, which is part of the <b>memory.bm</b> include file.  <u>Don&#39;t</u> use a
VARPTR pointer of a QB64 string variable here, first regular strings are
not usually zero terminated and second these pointers may get invalid at
any time due to the internal operations of QB64.  If you do not need a name,
but just a type and/or priority, then initialize the name field to zero, but
note in this case the node can never be found using the FUNCTION <b>FindName&amp;</b>
from the <b>lists.bm</b> include file.

This code fragment shows the initialization of a <b>ListNode&amp;</b> structure:

    np&amp; = CreateGPMString&amp;(&quot;sample.node&quot;)
    IF np&amp; = 0 THEN
      PRINT &quot;not enough memory for node name...&quot;
      &#39;
      &#39;you must handle this situation
      &#39;
    ELSE
      PokeB node&amp;, ln_Type&amp;, NT_...&amp;
      PokeB node&amp;, ln_Pri&amp;, -10&amp;
      PokeL node&amp;, ln_Name&amp;, np&amp;
    END IF

Whenever you unlink and free a named node initialized this way, then always
make sure to dispose the created name string <u>prior</u> to freeing the memory
occupied by the node structure itself:

    <u>first:</u>
      DisposeGPMString PeekL&amp;(node&amp;, ln_Name&amp;)
    <u>then:</u>                    _
      FreeGPMVec node&amp;        \ depends on the used
    <u>or:</u>                       / allocation method
      FreeGPMem node&amp;, size&amp; /
