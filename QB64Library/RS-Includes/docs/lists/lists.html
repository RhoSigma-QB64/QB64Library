<pre style="font-size:20px">
As mentioned earlier, a list header maintains memory pointers to the first
and last nodes of the linked chain of nodes.  It also serves as a handle
for referencing the entire list.  The minimum list header (&quot;mlh_&quot;) and the
full-featured list header (&quot;lh_&quot;) are generally interchangeable.
<hr>
The structure <b>MinListHeader&amp;</b> defines a minimum list header:

    DefSTRUCTURE MinListHeader&amp;, 0&amp;
    DefGPMPTR    mlh_Head&amp;
    DefGPMPTR    mlh_Tail&amp;
    DefGPMPTR    mlh_TailPred&amp;
    DefLABEL     MinListHeader_SizeOf&amp;

mlh_Head&amp;
    points to the first node in the list

mlh_Tail&amp;
    is always zero

mlh_TailPred&amp;
    points to the last node in the list
<hr>
In a few limited cases a full-featured <b>ListHeader&amp;</b> structure will
be required:

    DefSTRUCTURE ListHeader&amp;, 0&amp;
    DefGPMPTR    lh_Head&amp;
    DefGPMPTR    lh_Tail&amp;
    DefGPMPTR    lh_TailPred&amp;
    DefUBYTE     lh_Type&amp;
    DefUBYTE     lh_Pad&amp;
    DefLABEL     ListHeader_SizeOf&amp;

lh_Head&amp;
    points to the first node in the list

lh_Tail&amp;
    is always zero

lh_TailPred&amp;
    points to the last node in the list

lh_Type&amp;
    defines the type of nodes within the list (&quot;NT_&quot; types)

lh_Pad&amp;
    is a structure alignment byte
<hr>
One subtlety here must be explained further.  The list header is
constructed in an efficient, but confusing manner.  Think of the header as
a structure containing the head and tail nodes for the list.  The head and
tail nodes are placeholders, and never carry data.  The head and tail
portions of the header actually overlap in memory.  <b>lh_Head&amp;</b> and <b>lh_Tail&amp;</b>
form the head node, <b>lh_Tail&amp;</b> and <b>lh_TailPred&amp;</b> form the tail node.  This
makes it easy to find the start or end of the list, and eliminates any
special cases for insertion or removal.

                       |  ln_Pred&amp;  |       |lh_TailPred&amp;|

                   Figure 2: List Header Overlap

The <b>lh_Head&amp;</b> and <b>lh_Tail&amp;</b> fields of the list header act like the <b>ln_Succ&amp;</b> and
<b>ln_Pred&amp;</b> fields of a node.  The <b>lh_Tail&amp;</b> field is set permanently to zero,
indicating that the head node is indeed the first on the list -- that is,
it has no predecessors.  See the figure above.

Likewise, the <b>lh_Tail&amp;</b> and <b>lh_TailPred&amp;</b> fields of the list header act like
the <b>ln_Succ&amp;</b> and <b>ln_Pred&amp;</b> fields of a node. Here the zero <b>lh_Tail&amp;</b> indicates
that the tail node is indeed the last on the list -- that is, it has no
successors.  See the figure above.

Because of the facts discussed above it seems obvious, that headers must be
properly initialized before use.  It is not adequate to simply initialize all
header fields to zero.  The head and tail entries must have specific values.
<hr>
The header must be initialized for use as follows:

    1. Set the <b>lh_Head&amp;</b> field to the address of <b>lh_Tail&amp;</b>.

    2. Clear the <b>lh_Tail&amp;</b> field.

    3. Set the <b>lh_TailPred&amp;</b> field to the address of <b>lh_Head&amp;</b>.

    4. Set <b>lh_Type&amp;</b> to the same data type as the nodes to be kept in the list.
       (Unless you are using a <b>MinListHeader&amp;</b>).

    4.1. If you intent to link nodes of different data types into the list,
         then you rather should use an untyped <b>MinListHeader&amp;</b> and therefore
         full-featured <b>ListNode&amp;</b> structures to assign the types directly
         to the nodes.

    PokeL list&amp;, lh_Tail&amp;, 0&amp;
    PokeL list&amp;, lh_TailPred&amp;, (list&amp; + lh_Head&amp;)
    &#39;now, if needed
    PokeB list&amp;, lh_Type&amp;, NT_...&amp;

            Figure 3: Initializing a List Header Structure

The sequence of <b>PokeL</b> SUB calls in the figure above (except for the type
field) is equivalent to the SUB <b>NewList</b>, contained in the include file
<b>lists.bm</b>.  Since the <b>MinListHeader&amp;</b> structure is the same as the
<b>ListHeader&amp;</b> structure except for the type and pad fields, this sequence
of code will work for both structures.  However, the preferred way to
initialize a list header structure is to call the SUB <b>NewList</b> with the
list header&#39;s address, what will make your programs more readable.
