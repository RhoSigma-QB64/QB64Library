A little bit tricky are structures incorporating arrays.  In general, if
you just need a standalone array, then use a QB64 array, because these are
more easy to handle.  However, sometimes it is required to have an array
within a structure, because the structure content and the array content
depend on each other or have common belongings in general.
<hr>
Example of usage: (a structure with array)
------------------------------------------
    DefSTRUCTURE ArrStruct&amp;, 0&amp;
    DefULONG     as_Counter&amp;
    DefSTRUCT    as_Array&amp;, (10&amp; * 4&amp;)
    DefULONG     as_WhatEver&amp;
    DefLABEL     ArrStruct_SizeOf&amp;

once again with explaination:
-----------------------------
    DefSTRUCTURE ArrStruct&amp;, 0&amp;
      &#39;init the structure, guess you know already how it works

    DefULONG     as_Counter&amp;
      &#39;an ULONG entry, eg. the number of used array elements

    DefSTRUCT    as_Array&amp;, (10&amp; * 4&amp;)
      &#39;now here you use DefSTRUCT to incorporate the size of the complete array
        &#39;<b>as_Array&amp;</b> gets the current offset, which will be the base of the
         array for later access, <b>10&amp;</b> is the number of array elements and <b>4&amp;</b>
         the size of <u>one single</u> array element (here LONG)
          &#39;so in fact we created an array of 10 [0-9] LONG elements, defined
           as QB64 array you would write it DIM as_Array(9) AS LONG

    DefULONG     as_WhatEver&amp;
      &#39;another ULONG entry

    DefLABEL     ArrStruct_SizeOf&amp;
      &#39;finish the actual structure

To access the array elements with the appropriate <b>PokeXX</b> and <b>PeekXX</b> routines
(see <b>memory.bm</b>), I recommend adding the array&#39;s base offset to the structure
address and using the element number multiplied with the element size as offset.
For example, print all elements of the array defined above in a FOR..NEXT loop:

    &#39;assuming the structure address in <b>ptr&amp;</b>
    FOR i&amp; = 0 TO 9
        PRINT PeekL&amp;((ptr&amp; + <b>as_Array&amp;</b>), (i&amp; * <b>4&amp;</b>))
    NEXT i&amp;

However, you can of course find another way, as the <i>addr&amp;</i> and <i>offs&amp;</i> arguments
of the <b>PokeXX</b> and <b>PeekXX</b> routines are generally interchangable.
