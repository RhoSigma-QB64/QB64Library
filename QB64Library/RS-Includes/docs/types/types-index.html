The include files <b>types.bi/.bm</b> do provide a number of SUBs, which allow to
define structure data types as used by C++ and other programming languages.
This shall not be a replacement for QB64&#39;s DEF TYPE like data types, just
see it as a useful addition to it, which can be used where the QB64 native
DEF TYPE like data types seem unsuitable.

However, using these SUBs you just define the offsets of the structure
fields, so you still need storage space for the structure&#39;s content, and
routines to access it.  The solution for this problem are the include
files <b>memory.bi/.bm</b>, which implement the General Purpose Memory System.

The first low level application build on top of these two include file
pairs are doubly linked lists (<b>lists.bi/.bm</b>), which are one of the basic
constructs in clean content organization of common objects or records.
