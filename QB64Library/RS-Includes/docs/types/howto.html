<pre style="font-size:20px">
So why shall I use this SUBs instead of simply coding my offset symbols as
CONSTs with the offsets given as literals?
Because if you add/remove entries in your structure or changing the size of
an existing entry, then you must manually adjust all following offsets too.
This is annoying and may cause errors by miscalculations.  With these SUBs
you can do any required changes and all following offsets are adjusted
automatically.

Example of usage: (a simple structure)
--------------------------------------
    DefSTRUCTURE MyStruct&amp;, 0&amp;
    DefULONG     ms_1stLong&amp;
    DefULONG     ms_2ndLong&amp;
    DefBYTE      ms_SignedByte&amp;
    ALIGNWORD
    DefUWORD     ms_UnsignedWord&amp;
    DefLABEL     MyStruct_SizeOf&amp;

and again with explaination:
----------------------------
    DefSTRUCTURE MyStruct&amp;, 0&amp;
      &#39;this SUB does init a structure type, optional with start offset
        &#39;set the variable <b>MyStruct&amp;</b> = zero (always)
        &#39;init the offset counter to given start offset (here zero)

    DefULONG     ms_1stLong&amp;
      &#39;this SUB creates a 4-byte entry
        &#39;set the variable <b>ms_1stLong&amp;</b> = offset counter (is zero from the init above)
        &#39;increment the offset counter by 4 for the next entry

    DefULONG     ms_2ndLong&amp;
      &#39;the same SUB again to create another 4-byte entry
        &#39;set the variable <b>ms_2ndLong&amp;</b> = offset counter (now 4 from last increment)
        &#39;increment the offset counter by 4 for the next entry

    DefBYTE      ms_SignedByte&amp;
      &#39;this SUB creates a 1-byte entry
        &#39;set the variable <b>ms_SignedByte&amp;</b> = offset counter (now 8 from last increment)
        &#39;increment the offset counter by 1 for the next entry
          &#39;offset counter is now 9, which would be Ok for another BYTE entry,
           but is not a nice value for WORD, LONG etc. entries

    ALIGNWORD
      &#39;this SUB aligns the offset counter to (next) WORD boundary (here 10)
        &#39;if the offset counter is already on such a boundary, then this SUB
         does nothing, otherwise the next boundary will be calculated

    DefUWORD     ms_UnsignedWord&amp;
      &#39;this SUB creates a 2-byte entry
        &#39;set the variable <b>ms_UnsignedWord&amp;</b> = offset counter (now 10 from alignment)
        &#39;increment the offset counter by 2 for the next entry

    DefLABEL     MyStruct_SizeOf&amp;
      &#39;(here) this SUB is used to finish the actual structure
        &#39;set the variable <b>MyStruct_SizeOf&amp;</b> = offset counter (now 12 from last increment,
         this is the size required for this structure, use it to allocate storage
         space via the FUNCTIONs in <b>memory.bm</b>)
        &#39;this SUB does not increment the offset counter
<hr>
Another Example: (a structure incorporating the structure <b>MyStruct&amp;</b> twice (at
the beginning and in the middle), also it shall have a union)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    DefSTRUCTURE BigStruct&amp;, MyStruct_SizeOf&amp;
    DefLONG      bs_SigLong&amp;
    DefLABEL     bs_UniEnt1&amp;
    DefWORD      bs_UniEnt2&amp;
    DefWORD      bs_SigWord&amp;
    DefSTRUCT    bs_MyStruct&amp;, MyStruct_SizeOf&amp;
    DefULONG     bs_USigLong1&amp;
    DefULONG     bs_USigLong2&amp;
    DefLABEL     BigStruct_SizeOf&amp;

and once again with explaination:
---------------------------------
    DefSTRUCTURE BigStruct&amp;, MyStruct_SizeOf&amp;
      &#39;again this SUB does init the structure, here with a start offset,
       which is the size required for the structure <b>MyStruct&amp;</b> defined above)
        &#39;set the variable <b>BigStruct&amp;</b> = zero (always)
        &#39;init the offset counter to given start offset (here <b>MyStruct_SizeOf&amp;</b> (12))
          &#39;so now we have space for <b>MyStruct&amp;</b> at the beginning of <b>BigStruct&amp;</b>

    DefLONG      bs_SigLong&amp;
      &#39;this SUB creates a 4-byte entry again
        &#39;set the variable <b>bs_SigLong&amp;</b> = offset counter (is 12 from the init above)
        &#39;increment the offset counter by 4 for the next entry

    DefLABEL     bs_UniEnt1&amp;
      &#39;(here) this SUB is used to define the first label of a union
        &#39;set the variable <b>bs_UniEnt1&amp;</b> = offset counter (now 16 from last increment)
        &#39;this SUB does not increment the offset counter

    DefWORD      bs_UniEnt2&amp;
      &#39;this SUB creates a 2-byte entry again
        &#39;set the variable <b>bs_UniEnt2&amp;</b> = offset counter (still 16, as DefLABEL didn&#39;t increment)
        &#39;increment the offset counter by 2 for the next entry
          &#39;so now <b>bs_UniEnt1&amp;</b> and <b>bs_UniEnt2&amp;</b> have the same offset (union),
           as the last union entry was defined as a WORD, this size is also
           mandatory for the first union entry

    DefWORD      bs_SigWord&amp;
      &#39;this SUB creates another 2-byte entry
        &#39;set the variable <b>bs_SigWord&amp;</b> = offset counter (now 18 from last increment)
        &#39;increment the offset counter by 2 for the next entry

    DefSTRUCT    bs_MyStruct&amp;, MyStruct_SizeOf&amp;
      &#39;this SUB is used to incorporate another complete structure
        &#39;set the variable <b>bs_MyStruct&amp;</b> = offset counter (now 20 from last increment)
        &#39;increment the offset counter by the size of the incorporated structure (12)
          &#39;so now we have space for <b>MyStruct&amp;</b> in the middle of <b>BigStruct&amp;</b>

    DefULONG     bs_USigLong1&amp;
      &#39;this SUB creates a 4-byte entry again
        &#39;set the variable <b>bs_USigLong1&amp;</b> = offset counter (now 32 from last DefSTRUCT increment)
        &#39;increment the offset counter by 4 for the next entry

    DefULONG     bs_USigLong2&amp;
      &#39;the same SUB again to create another 4-byte entry
        &#39;set the variable <b>bs_USigLong2&amp;</b> = offset counter (now 36 from last increment)
        &#39;increment the offset counter by 4 for the next entry

    DefLABEL     BigStruct_SizeOf&amp;
      &#39;(here) the SUB DefLABEL is used again to finish the actual structure
        &#39;set the variable <b>BigStruct_SizeOf&amp;</b> = offset counter (now 40 from last increment,
         this is the size required for this structure, use it to allocate storage
         space via the FUNCTIONs in <b>memory.bm</b>)
        &#39;this SUB does not increment the offset counter

To access the entries in the first incorporated <b>MyStruct&amp;</b> you would simply use
the defined <b>ms_...</b> offsets itself or <b>BigStruct&amp;</b> + <b>ms_...</b>, the entries in the
second <b>MyStruct&amp;</b> you can access using <b>bs_MyStruct&amp;</b> + <b>ms_...</b> as offsets.

For an overview of all available <b>DefXXX</b> SUBs just take a look into <b>types.bm</b>,
you will quickly see how easy the system works and then you can also add
types for your own needs.
