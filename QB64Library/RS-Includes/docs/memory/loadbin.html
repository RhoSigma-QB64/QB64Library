DEFINITION - FUNCTION
    <i>addr&amp;</i> = <b>LoadBin&amp;</b>(<i>file$</i>) -- Load a file into GP memory

OPERATION
    <b>LoadBin&amp;</b> is a simple file loader function.  Each call to this function
    will allocate a new memory block large enough to hold the entire contents of
    the given file using the FUNCTION <b>AllocGPMVec&amp;</b>.  The result will be either
    the pointer to the new memory block or zero, if the file was to large.

ARGUMENTS
    <i>file$</i> -- the name of the file, if required inlusive a full path

RESULT
    <i>addr&amp;</i> -- a pointer to the newly allocated memory block, which contains
             the loaded file contents.  If there are no free memory regions
             large enough for the file contents, zero will be returned.

NOTES
    1.) The result of any file load <u>must</u> be checked, and a viable error handling
        path taken.  <u>Any</u> load may fail if memory has been filled.
    2.) If you are done with the loaded file contents, then you can free
        the used memory by passing the returned address to the SUB <b>FreeGPMVec</b>.
