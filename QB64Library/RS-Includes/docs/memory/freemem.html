DEFINITION - SUB
    <b>FreeGPMem</b> <i>addr&amp;</i>, <i>freeSize&amp;</i>
                         -- deallocate memory with knowledge of the size

OPERATION
    Free a region of memory, returning it to the GPM system pool.  Freeing
    partial blocks back into the GPM system is unwise.

ARGUMENTS
    <i>addr&amp;</i>     -- pointer to the memory block address to free
    <i>freeSize&amp;</i> -- the size of the block to free in bytes  (The GPM system
                 will automatically round this number to a multiple of the
                 minimum supported memory block size)

NOTES
    If a block of memory is freed twice, or you pass a wrong pointer, you
    will probably cause the GPM system to panic with an error.  There may
    be more sanity checks added in the future.
