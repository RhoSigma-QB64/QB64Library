DEFINITION - FUNCTION
    <i>diff&amp;</i> = <b>CompareGPMem&amp;</b>(<i>sAddr&amp;</i>, <i>cAddr&amp;</i>, <i>size&amp;</i>, <i>flags&amp;</i>)
                                -- compare two memory blocks to each other
OPERATION
    <b>CompareGPMem&amp;</b> will perform a byte by byte compare of the source data
    region with the compare data region.  It can deal with any arbitrary
    length and the pointers on arbitrary alignments.  The result includes
    the offset position of the first found difference plus the information
    whether the source byte was less/greater than the compared byte.

ARGUMENTS
    <i>sAddr&amp;</i> -- a address pointer to the source data region
    <i>cAddr&amp;</i> -- a address pointer to the compare data region
    <i>size&amp;</i>  -- the size (in bytes) to compare
    <i>flags&amp;</i> -- a bit field specifying further options

RESULT
    <i>diff&amp;</i>  -- offset position and state of first difference or zero, if
              both regions match exactly (see NOTES)

NOTES
    1.) If the <i>diff&amp;</i> result is zero, then both regions match exactly.
    2.) In all other cases <b>ABS</b>(<i>diff&amp;</i>)-1 is the byte offset of the first
        found difference, and <b>SGN</b>(<i>diff&amp;</i>) says whether the source byte was
        less than the compared byte (negativ) or greater than (positive).

FLAGS
    The <i>flags&amp;</i> defined in the include file <b>memory.bi</b> are bit-coded values,
    hence they can easily combined by ORing or adding them:

    <b>gpmF_Unsigned&amp;</b> -- If given, then the compare operation uses unsigned
                      math, otherwise signed math if omitted.

    This information is required, because in signed math bytes with its MSB
    set are <u>in general</u> less than bytes with a cleared MSB, but in unsigned
    math it&#39;s the opposite case.
