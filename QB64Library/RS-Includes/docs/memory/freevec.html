DEFINITION - SUB
    <b>FreeGPMVec</b> <i>addr&amp;</i> -- return <b>AllocGPMVec&amp;</b> memory to the GPM system

OPERATION
    Free an allocation made by the <b>AllocGPMVec&amp;</b> call.  The memory will be
    returned to the GPM system pool.

ARGUMENTS
    <i>addr&amp;</i> -- pointer to the memory block address to free

NOTES
    If a block of memory is freed twice, or you pass a wrong pointer, you
    will probably cause the GPM system to panic with an error.  There may
    be more sanity checks added in the future.
