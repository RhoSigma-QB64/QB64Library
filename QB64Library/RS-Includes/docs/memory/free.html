The following examples free the memory blocks of the example allocation
calls to <b>AllocGPMem&amp;</b>, shown in the previous chapter.

    <b>FreeGPMem</b> <i>apointer&amp;</i>, <i>100&amp;</i>
    <b>FreeGPMem</b> <i>anotherptr&amp;</i>, <i>1000&amp;</i>

A memory block allocated with <b>AllocGPMVec&amp;</b> must be returned to the GP Memory
system with the SUB <b>FreeGPMVec</b>.  This SUB uses the stored size in the
allocation to free the memory block, so there is no need to specify the
size of the memory block to free.

    <b>FreeGPMVec</b> <i>yap&amp;</i>

<b>FreeGPMem</b> and <b>FreeGPMVec</b> return no status.  However, if you attempt to free
a memory block in the middle of a block that the system believes is already
free, you will cause the GPM system to panic with an error.  Programs should
free the <u>same size</u> memory blocks that they allocated.  An allocated block
<u>should not</u> be deallocated as smaller pieces.  Due to the internal way the
GPM system rounds up and aligns allocations, partial deallocations can cause
corruption of the GPM system&#39;s free memory list, if they are not carefully
pre-aligned.  Memory blocks allocated with <b>AllocGPMVec&amp;</b> can never partially
deallocated in a safe way.
