DEFINITION - SUB
    <b>DumpGPMem</b> <i>file$</i>, <i>flags&amp;</i> -- create a dump of current memory contents

OPERATION
    For debugging purposes you may call this SUB to create a memory dump,
    which contains header information, a list of free areas and a complete
    printout of the array used by the GPM system.

ARGUMENTS
    <i>file$</i>  -- the name of the dump file, if required inlusive a full path
    <i>flags&amp;</i> -- a bit field with any special characteristics (see below)

NOTES
    The contents in the GP memory is hold in big-endian notation, hence you
    find all numbers in its mathematical correct bit order just as you would
    get it using HEX$.

FLAGS
    The <i>flags&amp;</i> defined in the include file <b>memory.bi</b> are bit-coded values,
    hence they can easily combined by ORing or adding them:

    <b>gpmF_MarkFree&amp;</b>   -- If given, then all free LONGs in the GP Memory region
                        will be filled with the word &quot;free&quot;.  This gives a
                        better overview in the memory dump.
    <b>gpmF_NoFreeList&amp;</b> -- This flag will supress the output of the free
                        areas list, which may become very long sometimes.
