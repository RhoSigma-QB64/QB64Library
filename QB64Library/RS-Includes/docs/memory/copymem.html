DEFINITION - SUB
    <b>CopyGPMem</b> <i>sAddr&amp;</i>, <i>dAddr&amp;</i>, <i>size&amp;</i> -- general purpose memory copy function

OPERATION
    <b>CopyGPMem</b> is a general purpose, fast memory copy function.  It can deal
    with arbitrary lengths, with its pointers on arbitrary alignments.
    It attempts to optimize larger copies with more efficient copies, it
    uses byte copies for small moves, parts of larger copies, or the entire
    copy if the source and destination are misaligned with respect to each
    other.  Arbitrary overlapping copies are explicitly supported.

ARGUMENTS
    <i>sAddr&amp;</i> -- a address pointer to the source data region
    <i>dAddr&amp;</i> -- a address pointer to the destination data region
    <i>size&amp;</i>  -- the size (in bytes) of the memory area to copy
