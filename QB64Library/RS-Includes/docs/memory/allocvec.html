DEFINITION - FUNCTION
    <i>addr&amp;</i> = <b>AllocGPMVec&amp;</b>(<i>getSize&amp;</i>, <i>flags&amp;</i>)
                            -- allocate memory and keep track of the size

OPERATION
    This function works identically to <b>AllocGPMem&amp;</b>, but tracks the size
    of the allocation.

ARGUMENTS
    <i>getSize&amp;</i> -- the size of the desired block in bytes  (The GPM system
                will automatically round this number to a multiple of the
                minimum supported memory block size)
    <i>flags&amp;</i>   -- a bit field with any special characteristics (see below)

RESULT
    <i>addr&amp;</i>    -- a pointer to the newly allocated memory block.  If there
                are no free memory regions large enough to satisfy the
                request, zero will be returned.

NOTES
    1.) The result of any memory allocation <u>must</u> be checked, and a viable
        error handling path taken.  <u>Any</u> allocation may fail if memory has
        been filled.
    2.) If the free memory list is corrupt, the GPM system will panic with
        an error.

FLAGS
    The <i>flags&amp;</i> defined in the include file <b>memory.bi</b> are bit-coded values,
    hence they can easily combined by ORing or adding them:

    <b>gpmF_NoAdd&amp;</b> -- Don&#39;t try to extend the current GP Memory region, if
                   there is not enough free space to satisfy the request.
    <b>gpmF_Clear&amp;</b> -- The just allocated memory block will be initialized
                   to all zeros.
