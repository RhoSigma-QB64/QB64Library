    <b><u>RhoSigma&#39;s Include File Documentation</u></b>

This is the developer manual for my include files.  I recommend reading
this completely at least once, before using it as reference.  The chapters
are build and linked in the order, which I think, gives you the best idea
how the single parts work together.

<u>The basics:</u>
 <a href="types/types-index.html">Alternative Types -------- types.bi/.bm</a>      <a href="types/funcref.html">Reference</a>
 <a href="memory/memory-index.html">General Purpose Memory --- memory.bi/.bm</a>     <a href="memory/funcref.html">Reference</a>

<u>Extensions:</u>
 <a href="lists/lists-index.html">Doubly linked Lists ------ lists.bi/.bm</a>      <a href="lists/funcref.html">Reference</a>

There are some more extensions in my mind, which will be released as soon
as they are coded and proved to run stable.  As example for the usage of
these include files take a look to the source <b>Phonebook.bas</b>, it&#39;s not fancy
or useful at all, but shows the basic usage with lots of comments.
