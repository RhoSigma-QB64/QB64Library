This implementation of the RhoSigma Includes for QB64 and its examples
were an attempt to create a facility for independent data storage and
management in any QB64 programs before the _MEM blocks system was built
into the language. This work is inspired by the respective methods used
in the AmigaOS, which I tried to rebuild in QB64.

Note that this library is mostly outdated since _MEM blocks were built
into QB64. I'll no longer maintain it and provide it here "as is" for
educational purposes in the Public Domain (see PD-Unlicense.txt). This
