This implementation of the Polygon Support library for QB64 and its examples
is based on the Geometry/Math examples described by Darel Rex Finley (DRF)
on his web site http://alienryderflex.com/tutorials.shtml.

As DRF's examples are placed in the Public Domain, I'll not claim any
rights or impose restrictions on this library as well, it's unlicensed
and will remain in the Public Domain (see PD-Unlicense.txt). This applies
to the entire contents in this distribution, namely:
    - polygons.bm
    - docs\ (entire contents)
    - example\3dFuncPlot.bas
    - example\FractalMountains.bas
    - example\Polygons-HowTo.bas
