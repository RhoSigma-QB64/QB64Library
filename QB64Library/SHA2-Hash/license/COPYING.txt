This SHA2 hashing library for QB64 is based on the SHA2 sources of Notepad++.

Although I did some changes to fit the whole thing into a QB64 library,
I'am not the author or copyright holder of the SHA2 Secure Hash Algorithm.
Also note that this library does only implement the SHA-256 algorithm out
of the entire SHA2 family algorithms.

SHA2 is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United
States National Security Agency (NSA) and patented in US patent 6829355.
The United States has released the patent under a royalty-free license,
it applies to the following files in this distribution:
    - sha2.h

However, the implementation of the QB64 wrapper library and its examples
is unlicensed and placed in the Public Domain (see PD-Unlicense.txt), it
applies to the following files in this distribution:
    - sha2.bi
    - sha2.bm
    - docs\ (entire contents)
    - example\SHA2-HowTo.bas
