This DES56 en-/decryption library for QB64 is based on the DES56 sources
found here:
    - http://aminet.net/package/dev/gg/Crypt-1.0
    - http://aminet.net/package/dev/gg/Crypt-2.0

Although I did some changes to fit the whole thing into a QB64 library,
I'am not the author or copyright holder of this DES56 implementation.
