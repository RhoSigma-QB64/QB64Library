This implementation of the LZW pack-/unpacker library for QB64 and its
examples is based on LZW examples by Rich Geldreich, in particular the
ones you can download here:
 https://qbasic.east-power-soft.de/index.php?menu=quickbasic_quickbasic_tuts_zip#lzw

As Rich's examples are placed in the Public Domain, I'll not claim any
rights or impose restrictions on this library as well, it's unlicensed
and will remain in the Public Domain (see PD-Unlicense.txt). This applies
to the entire contents in this distribution, namely:
    - lzwpacker.bm
    - docs\ (entire contents)
    - example\LZW-HowTo.bas
